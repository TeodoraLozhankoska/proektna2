      <p><h4><strong>How to master your time</strong></h4>

      <em><strong>desc: The secret to time management is simple: Jedi time tricks.</strong></em> <br /><br />
        
        Imagine you were a Jedi master called Bob (your parents, whilst skilled in the ways of the force weren’t the best at choosing names).
        The love of your life – Princess Lucia – is trapped in a burning building as you hurry to save her.
        You might think of Lucia as the embodiment of your dreams, your aspirations – she is your most important thing.
        
        Unfortunately, before you can reach her an army of stormtroopers open fire.
        The incoming stream of lasers demand your attention – if you fail to dodge them, you’re dead. 
        You might think of them as an urgent distraction from saving your princess.
        
        We all know how a hero resolves this dilemma. If he takes his eye off the ultimate goal – his princess – then all his other efforts are for nought. 
        He can engage an army of stormtroopers, cutting them down with graceful ease, but their numbers are limitless, and whilst momentarily satisfying they only distract him. 
        Delayed too long, his princess will die.
        
        And so it is with your life. You have things that are most important and things that are most urgent in permanent competition.
        
        The secret to mastering your time is to systematically focus on importance and suppress urgency. 
        Humans are pre-wired to focus on things which demand an immediate response, like alerts on their phones – and to postpone things which are most important, like going to the gym. 
        You need to reverse that, which goes against your brain and most of human society.Look at what you spend your day doing. Most of it, I’ll warrant, is not anything you chose – it’s what is being asked of you.
        Here’s how we fix that, young padawan: unplug the TV, kill notifications, schedule your priorities, decrease volume on your phone. Less is more.</p>

      <p><h4><strong>What to Cook When You Don’t Feel Like Cooking</strong></h4>

        <em><strong>desc:Here’s a puzzle: A home-cooked meal is often most beneficial on nights when you’re extremely hungry and just don’t feel like cooking.
        </strong></em> <br /><br />
          
         <p>I’ve had, um, experience with this conundrum. As a food writer and the author of I Dream of Dinner, I spend all day creating recipes,
          so I don’t always want to keep cooking once I’m off work. There’s a catalog of dishes, though, I know I can pull off no matter what. 
         They’re not always brilliant, and they don’t always include a vegetable, and that’s okay: They get me to bed with warm food in my belly, 
         which is something to be grateful for every single day. I think of these easy meals in three main categories: <br />
        <br /> 1. Eggs <br />
         
         — A fried egg on a potato bun, with a dribble of ketchup and/or hot sauce, is so essential that I sneaked a “recipe” for it into my cookbook.<br />
         
         — Other good eggs-plus-starch combos are egg tacos and fatoot samneh. <br />
         
         — Eggs scrambled in the pan with a fork, plus cured meat (salami, bacon, chorizo), a vegetable, or cheese if the cutting board’s already out.<br />
         
         <br />2. Toast and Friends <br />
         — My mom, the best cook I know, has her own arsenal of default meals. My favorite growing up was a big arugula salad, tossed with lemon juice and olive oil, plus blue cheese toasts: Slice crusty bread, top with blue cheese, broil until molten. In my cookbook, this idea morphed into a Buffalo salad with crunchy greens, celery, and a hot sauce dressing (above). The blue cheese toasts remain unaltered.<br />
         
         — A toastie with cheese and sauerkraut (or pickled condiments), kind of like an open-faced grilled cheese.<br />
         
         — Baked flatbreads with cheese and vegetables, made with store-bought flatbread, naan, or pocketless pita.<br />
         
         <br />3. Pantry Diving <br />
         — My mom’s “emergency chickpeas” meal from college is more satisfying than you’d expect: drained chickpeas, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt.<br />
         
         — Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, also known as “Midnight Pasta” because it fulfills that late-night urge for starch, spice, and a slap of garlic.<br />
         
         — Snack dinner: Find one or two sources of protein and a vegetable and you made dinner.
